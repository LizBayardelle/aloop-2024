                    We usually ship overseas orders via US Mail Global Express Mail service. It takes about 3-5 days to reach Europe and 7-10 days to reach Asia and Australia. Cost for Global Express Mail shipping is usually about $150 USD per kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The kit comes in two boxes so it does not travel as an oversize parcel. With Global Express Mail we can track the progress of the packages and it's been a very reliable method to get our products overseas.
